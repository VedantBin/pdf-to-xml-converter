## 💾 Database Configuration

The application supports both in-memory storage (for development) and MongoDB (for production):

### MongoDB Configuration
1. Create a MongoDB Atlas account or set up a local MongoDB instance
2. Add your MongoDB connection string to the `.env` file as `MONGODB_URI`
3. The application will automatically connect to MongoDB and handle migration

#### Setting Up MongoDB Atlas (Recommended)
1. Create a free account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register)
2. Create a new cluster (the free tier is sufficient)
3. In the Security tab, create a database user with read/write permissions
4. In the Network Access tab, add your IP address or allow access from anywhere for development
5. Click "Connect" on your cluster, select "Connect your application"
6. Copy the connection string and replace `<password>` with your database user's password
7. Add this connection string to your `.env` file as `MONGODB_URI`

#### Storage Failover System
The application includes an automatic storage failover system:
- The system will attempt to connect to MongoDB on startup
- If MongoDB is unavailable, it will automatically use in-memory storage
- It periodically checks MongoDB connection status (every 30 seconds)
- When MongoDB becomes available, it automatically switches to MongoDB storage
- Any data created during the MongoDB outage will be migrated to MongoDB when connection is restored

## 🔐 Authentication System

The application implements a secure authentication system with the following features:

### User Registration Requirements
- Email validation with proper format checking
- Password requirements:
  - Minimum 6 characters
  - Must contain at least one symbol
  - Must contain at least one lowercase letter
  - Must contain at least one uppercase letter

### Security Features
- JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Protected routes that require authentication
- Automatic token refresh
- Session management with secure HTTP-only cookies

### Authentication Flow
1. User registers with email and password
2. Password is validated against security requirements
3. Password is hashed before storage in the database
4. On login, credentials are verified and a JWT token is issued
5. Token is stored in an HTTP-only cookie for security
6. Protected API routes validate the token before allowing access

## 🚀 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Authentication |
|----------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `/api/register` | POST | Create a new user account | No |
| `/api/login` | POST | Log in to an existing account | No |
| `/api/logout` | POST | Log out of the current session | Yes |
| `/api/user` | GET | Get the current user's information | Yes |
| `/api/convert` | POST | Convert a PDF file to XML | Yes |
| `/api/conversions` | GET | Get a list of the user's conversions | Yes |
| `/api/conversions/:id` | GET | Get a specific conversion | Yes |
| `/api/conversions/:id` | DELETE | Delete a specific conversion | Yes |

## 🔄 Storage Management

The application includes a sophisticated storage management system that:

1. Automatically detects MongoDB availability
2. Gracefully falls back to in-memory storage when MongoDB is unavailable
3. Periodically checks MongoDB connection status and switches storage implementations as needed
4. Migrates data from in-memory to MongoDB when connection is established

- **Light Mode**: Soft pastel palette (#8F87F1, #C68EFD, #E9A5F1, #FED2E2)

## 🔍 Advanced Filtering

The application provides comprehensive filtering capabilities for the conversion history:

### Search Filters
